#1. comparison in chemical removal efficiency between seasons.
#2. Possible comparison in removal efficeincy between weeks.
#3. Threshold for chemicals = 70% (presence of absence).
#4. Negative values-how to handle negative values.
#5. Post-Hoc analysis.



#a. Negative values for removal efficiency.
-i report the negative removal efficiency as they are, and discuss the potential reasons for the increase in concentration. 
-This will provide a more accurate representation of the treatment process, and help identify areas for improvement.
-ii consider the type of chemical and the treatment process when interpreting negative removal efficiency.

#a. Handling presence or absence of values for some chemicals.
-i if a variable has more than 70% missing data, it should potentially be excluded.
