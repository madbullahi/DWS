#A. Dataset description
The data consist of the following variables:
-i. Replicates: indicates the number of repeated measurement for each combination of chemical per week.
-ii. Chemical: Lists the names or identifiers of the different chemicals or compounds analysed.
-iii. Week: Represents the time point or week at which the measurement were taken.
-iv. Removal_Efficiency: Contains the numerical values representing the removal efficiency of each chemical at the corresponding week.

# The dataset includes measurements for 32 different chemicals over a period of 12 weeks.
# Some chemicals have data for all 12 weeks, while others  have missing values for certain weeks.
# the removal efficiency values range from negative numbers to positive values.


#B. Data Preprocessing.
-before conducting the analysis, the following data preprocessing steps were performed.
#1. Filtering Chemicals: Chemicals that were present in less than 50% of the weeks were excludes from the analysis. This was done to avoid potential 
bias introduced by chemicals with a high percentage of missing data.


#C. ANOVA Analysis.
-i Initially, a linear mixed-effects model with Week, Chemical and their interaction as fixed effects, with Replicates (i.e. values from days) as a random effect, was attempted.
However, this model encountered a rank deficiency error, likely due to the large number parameters, missing data patterns and potential colinearity.
-ii. final model: To address this rank deficiency issue, the model was simplified by removing the interaction term and considering only the main effcts of Week and Chemical. This revised
model was fitted using the lmer() function from the lmertest package in R

model<- lmer(Removal_Efficiency~Chemical + Week +(1|Chemical:Replicates), data = data).
